## Resume point (read this first after /clear or a new session)

Updated: 2026-10-02, after commit 195826e (T1.3a). The orchestrator rewrites this section after every commit.

- **Branch:** `phase/1-data`. Plan: ADR-005 (approved by Steph with changes), nflverse facts: ADR-006. Full plan text: `~/.claude/plans/fresh-session-after-clear-dazzling-cat.md` (local only; ADR-005 plus the Phase 1 task table below carry everything needed).
- **Committed and verified:** B0, T1.0, T1.1 (+fix), T1.2a (+fix), T1.4a, T1.3a. Batch A0+A code review saved (part 1); fixes applied.
- **In flight when this was written (lost if the session ends):**
  - T1.2b Sleeper endpoints (sleeper-data-engineer), writing `packages/sleeper/src/**` and `docs/sleeper-api-notes.md` section 4.5.
  - Code review of T1.4a (code-reviewer, read-only), to be saved as `docs/reviews/2026-10-02-p1-batchA-part2-code.md`.
- **If resuming after an interruption:** run `git status`. Uncommitted files under `packages/sleeper/src` (outside `http/`) or edits to `docs/sleeper-api-notes.md` are a partial T1.2b: either re-dispatch T1.2b with "continue from the existing files" or `git checkout -- docs/sleeper-api-notes.md && git clean -fd packages/sleeper/src` (only the non-http files) and re-dispatch fresh. Re-run the T1.4a review (`git show d5b2200`).
- **Next steps, in order:**
  1. Verify and commit T1.2b; save the T1.4a review; fix any Blocker/Major.
  2. Dispatch T1.4b (nflverse provider; brief must carry ADR-006 join order, alias table, LA/LAR, kickoff conversion, carry share, `rz_touches` null).
  3. Code review of Batch B (T1.2b, T1.3a, T1.4b); fix Blocker/Major.
  4. Batch C: T1.3b, T1.5a, T1.6 (see task table and ADR-005). Then D, E, F, G per the table.
- **Every brief carries:** the Node 24 PATH prefix, `.env`-only identifiers (ADR-000), msw 3, no `.skip`/weakened thresholds, only T1.0/devops changes dependencies (ADR-005 item 15), report-don't-fix failures in other agents' paths, `pnpm run sync` not `pnpm sync`.
- **Before every commit:** `pnpm verify` (or targeted checks if a parallel agent's files are mid-edit, then full verify before the next batch), identifier scan of the staged diff against `.env`, `pnpm fixtures:check` when fixtures change.

Plan: ADR-005. Approved changes: single caller enforced (CLI enqueues to a live worker; renewed DB lease), projection real-row rule documented per endpoint with a week 5 non-empty test and bye handling via schedule, red-zone touches dropped to P1 if they need play-by-play.

## Standing rules for briefs

- Real identifiers (username, league id, league name, user ids, manager and team names) are read from `.env` and never written to tracked files (ADR-000).
- Partial weeks (in progress at recording time) are excluded from SCORE-2 validation and golden expectations (ADR-000 item 9). Phase 3 briefs must restate this.
- Agents use Node 24: prefix shell commands with `export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/fnm/node-versions/v24.21.0/installation/bin:$PATH"` (the tool shell defaults to Node 25).

## Backlog (Minor findings and follow-ups)

- T1.0 (was T1.3): add `better-sqlite3: true` under `allowBuilds` in pnpm-workspace.yaml (pnpm 12 blocks native builds by default).
- T4.3: revisit health semantics once the supervisor exists; a worker heartbeat stale beyond a threshold should probably fail the Docker healthcheck (ADR-005 item 6).
- ADR-001: TypeScript pinned to 6.0.3 (not 7.x) because typescript-eslint 8.71 requires `<6.1`. Revisit when typescript-eslint supports TS 7.
- Image size: the gate measures `docker image inspect` Size (93.3 MB arm64, 93.2 MB amd64 for web alone; HOST-5 limit 400 MB). OrbStack's "disk usage" column (about 400 MB) is not the measure.
- Route JS headroom: the placeholder page already ships about 132 KB of 200 KB gzipped script. Frontend briefs (T2.1+) must lazy-load charts and watch bundle size.
- Lighthouse best-practices is 0.96 against a 0.95 floor on the placeholder page.
- Review m4: resolved in ADR-005 item 8 (api and worker at 75% lines).
- Playwright `--project` is variadic: put the spec path before `--project`.
- tests/fixtures/README.md should list the extra manifest keys the recorder writes (currentWeek, futureMatchupWeeks, projectionWeeks, statsWeeks, syntheticLeagueId, sanitizerVersion, trimming). Owner: qa-engineer.
- `pnpm fixtures:check` needs the gitignored raw cache or live API, so it cannot run in CI. The orchestrator runs it plus an independent live-fetched identifier scan before every commit and at every gate.
- Fixtures are 5.6 MB (target under 6 MB): little headroom for re-recording more weeks; re-record with trimming rather than growing.
- G0 review N1: `pnpm gate --only=...` overwrites `docs/gates/latest.json`; write partial runs to `latest.partial.json`. Owner: devops-engineer.
- G0 review N3: `reuseExistingServer: !CI` in playwright.config.ts can reuse a stale local server. Owner: qa-engineer.
- G0 review N4: UI3 should wait for port 3000 to be released after stopping the shared server. Owner: devops-engineer.
- G0 review n1 and Batch C n2: document the Lighthouse script-size unit; update tests/fixtures/README.md fake id ranges, manifest keys and the short-name word-boundary rule. Owner: qa-engineer.
- T1.0: pnpm prints a peer-dependency warning on install (not investigated). @types/better-sqlite3 9.6.0 may lag the v13 API. Worker stub scripts use root tsx; add tsx to the worker when real scripts land. Owner: devops-engineer (T1.8).
- Per-project coverage (`vitest run --coverage --project X`) prints Unknown% because coverage globs are repo-relative; use the whole-repo run. Owner: qa-engineer (T1.7a).
- T1.2b/T1.5b: pass a `Sideline/<version> (self-hosted)` user agent; `/players/nfl` calls pass `{ etag: false }`; the worker shares one `RateLimiter`.
- P1: nflverse play-by-play for red-zone touches (TREND-2), ADR-006 item 6.
- T1.8 (devops): declare zod and tsx in packages/db (imported/used but resolved via root hoisting); bundle `packages/db/drizzle/` migrations into the image or set `SIDELINE_MIGRATIONS_DIR`. `cli/migrate.ts` has no unit test (covered by the CLI run; db total 91.6%).
- T1.4a review m6/m8 (sleeper-data-engineer): nflverse recorder `--refresh`, size check, fetch timeout, zod for release JSON, root from import.meta.url, write-then-swap; label 14f join rates as spike measurements or add `--report`.
- msw is 3.0.1; @vitest/mocker lists an optional msw ^2 peer (browser mode only, unused). Briefs using MSW must point agents at msw 3 APIs.
